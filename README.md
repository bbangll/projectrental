## General info & Rules

Welcome to SwiftDrop Ecommerce! I've always wanted to create an ecommerce website from scratch and I'm slowly getting there.
In this website you can't buy anything but you can create, update and delete an item that you've created.

Good Luck!!

## Getting Started

Instructions:
1. Click here to open the app - [SwiftDrop Ecommerce](https://projectrental.herokuapp.com/)
2. Sign in
3. Try adding, updating and deleting items.
4. If you're logged in you could add reviews to an item.
5. Have fun.

Note: Each time you click on an item you could also see how many views that item has.

## Next Steps
- I want to add images to each item, would make it so much realistic.
- I want to add crud operations to the reviews.
